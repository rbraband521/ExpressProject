# ExpressProject
Static Node.js and Express Portfolio Project
I wasn't necessarily going to exceeds expectations but found myself trucking along in that way so just continued with it. Changes in the CSS file include:
  backgroud color change to everything
  Italicized the text with the paragraph tag
  Centered the text under each thumbnail on the home page, i thought it was more aesthetically pleasing
  Added a shadow to the main text (h1)
  
 Added a larger logo on the main page and a small logo on the about and project pages
